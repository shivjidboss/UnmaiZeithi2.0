 

### DESIGN DECISIONS

We are proposing a new system UZ based on a public  Block-chain for determining authenticity of Information. The authenticity of Information has been a longstanding issue affecting individuals, businesses and society, both for printed and digital media. With the advent of social networks, the reach and effects of information spread occur at such a fast pace and so amplified that distorted, inaccurate or false information acquires a tremendous potential to cause real world impacts, within minutes, for millions of users. Societal issues are being raised about the individual's ability to tell apart what is fake and what is authentic, while surfing and actively engaging in information overloaded networks. 

Youngsters are known to be tech-savvy when compared to their parents, but when it comes to the ability to tell if a news piece is fake or not, they seem as confused as the rest of the society and 44% have confirmed it in a research conducted by Common Sense Media. The same research also indicates that 31% of kids aged 10 to 18 have shared online at least one news story that they later found out was inaccurate or fake. This situation raises a whole new dimension of concerns related to digital literacy that go beyond the mere ability to access and manage technology. 

In the above context, establishing the reliability of online information is a daunting but critical current challenge. Fake news detection is defined as the prediction of the chances of a particular news article to be intentionally deceiving.  We propose decentralised platform aiming to authenticate the genuinity of news, making it easier to spot  trusted and useful information, preventing the spreading of misinformation. Spreading genuine knowledge to make life better. An attempt to fight fake news.We intend to use *blockchain* for keeping track of ‘*votes*’ garnered by each article .

This system is built using these technologies:

1. Go-Ethereum
2. Node.js
3. Truffle
4. Angular 7
5. Express
6. Fastify
7. Docker
8. Nginx

The system consist of a simple D-App with a login and sign-up page as well as a home page for the user to view the published articles.In order for the user to be a part of this network, he should already be a part of Ethereum network with some ether to spend.

If the user is part of Ethereum network he can register to be a part of UZ. Any registered user can publish there article ,in the form of URL to the web page that the article was published.

The system is build with the help of docker to help with easy deploying of the app.

Why Ethereum? , because it is one of the fastest public block-chain network available and it support smart-contracts bringing programmability to the world of block-chain.

> Ethereum is a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications. On Ethereum, you can write code that controls digital value, runs exactly as programmed, and is accessible anywhere in the world.

***Go-Ethereum*** is the official Golang implementation of the Ethereum protocol.

***Node.js*** is a JavaScript run-time built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.It is single threaded and easy to program

***Truffle*** is a part of the Truffle Suit which is a set of software packages used for developing in Ethereum block-chain.

> A world class development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for block-chains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), aiming to make life as a developer easier.

***Angular*** is a platform for building mobile and desktop web applications.

***Express*** is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications

> Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js

***Fastify*** is a web framework highly focused on providing the best developer experience with the least overhead and a powerful plugin architecture.

>  Fast and low overhead web framework, for Node.js

***Docker*** is a collection of inter-operating software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service offerings that employ operating-system-level virtualisation to cultivate development and delivery of software inside standardised software packages called containers

>  Securely build, share and run any application, anywhere

***Nginx*** is a web server which can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache.
